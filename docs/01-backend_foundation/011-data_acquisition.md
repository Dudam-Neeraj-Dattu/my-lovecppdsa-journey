# 1.1 From Playlist to Platform: Data Acquisition

The first significant challenge was data acquisition. This was not a simple matter of consuming a pre-existing API; it required a dedicated, manual effort. I meticulously reviewed over 150 videos in the Love Babbar DSA C++ playlist to compile a comprehensive list of 222 problems, carefully noting the lecture numbers, topic names, and the order in which the problems were solved. I also combined this with the problem links I had collected throughout my six-month learning journey from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Code360.

Initially, I tried organizing this data using Whimsical, but since some problems have multiple links, I found it lacking the flexibility to include all the necessary information. So, I switched to Excel, creating columns for problem name, LeetCode, Code360, and GFG links. Alongside, I planned to write the topic name, lecture range, and problem row range in a separate sheet. However, this approach also felt cumbersome.

Eventually, I decided to add the topic names and lecture ranges directly into the same sheet by merging four cells in a row for each topic, followed by the individual problems. This structure—merging cells for topic headers and then listing the problems underneath—proved to be both clear and efficient. I completed the process by going through the entire playlist, storing all the problems with their respective links, topics, and lecture ranges in this organized format.

This manual but crucial phase resulted in a clean, structured, and comprehensive dataset that became the backbone of the entire
