# My Motivation

It all began in July 2024, when my professor recommended that I take the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course as part of my master’s program for the fall 2024. He believed it would be a perfect fit for me that fall, even though it meant passing up his own course. I soon discovered that this DAA course was taught by a professor whose reputation for rigor and difficulty made most students hesitant to enroll. But I was eager for a challenge—I wanted to see for myself what made Data Structures and Algorithms such a formidable subject.

About a week before the semester started, I stumbled upon the renowned Love Babbar C++ DSA playlist on YouTube, a comprehensive series of around 150 videos. I dove in, brushing up on my C++ skills and immersing myself in the world of data structures and algorithms. As the semester began, I balanced this intense self-study with my demanding university coursework. The journey was transformative: not only did I earn an 'A' in what was considered the toughest course, but I also experienced a fundamental shift in my problem-solving abilities. My mind began to tackle challenges I never thought possible—though the journey was never easy, I could feel myself improving every day.

Throughout this process, I faced two persistent challenges:
1. **Tracking Progress:** With hundreds of problems spread across various topics, it was difficult to keep track of what I had completed and what remained.
2. **Finding Community:** I often found myself scrolling through YouTube comments, where people searching for fellow learners to discuss problems with—a study buddy on the same journey.

After six months of daily DSA practice, and a brief break after my spring semester, I realized I could address these very challenges. I had always wanted to build a real-world application that solved a genuine problem, and this was my opportunity. That’s when the idea for **LoveCppDSA** was born.

Here is the original synopsis I wrote down when the idea first came to me:

> #### Project: lovecppdsa application
>
> an application to track your progress in solving the problems of whole playlist
>
> this website project will have username, email and password login facitlity, so that a user can create an account and start tracking their progress in solving the problems.
>
> this website has several sections depening on the topic and each topic has set of problems with each prooblem having a check of whether completed or not, and each problem has its own page that gives an option to save your own code.
>
> this application can go to next level by allowing users to chat and combine with other use and do as a pair, like it develops a commuity of people who are at the same level.
>
> this is just the initial thought of the project, more or less features can be added or deleted later based on the flow of the project.

That initial thought grew into the full-featured, AI-powered, real-time platform you see today.
