    "description": "The integration of an AI-powered tutor is the application's most advanced feature, demonstrating the use of modern AI frameworks and architectures. The system is based on several core concepts. At its center is a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically Google's Gemini Pro, which provides generative text capabilities.\n\nThe implementation extends beyond a basic API call by leveraging the LangChain framework—a toolkit for building complex, multi-step LLM applications. The key architectural element is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which addresses the challenge of LLMs lacking context-specific knowledge. When a user asks a question about a particular DSA problem, the backend retrieves relevant data (such as title, links, and difficulty) from the MongoDB database. This information is then used to augment the prompt sent to the Gemini model, grounding the AI's response in factual, application-specific data and enabling focused, intelligent conversations.\n\nThe data flow for the AI chat is designed with user experience in mind. Rather than a simple request-response cycle, the system implements an 'optimistic UI' pattern: when a user sends a message, the frontend immediately updates the chat window with a temporary ID. The complete conversation history is sent to the backend, which interacts with the AI and returns only the essential data—the permanent message ID and the AI's response. The frontend then reconciles its state accordingly. This approach prioritizes perceived performance and API efficiency. Additionally, data storage is managed using MongoDB TTL (Time-To-Live) indexes to automatically delete temporary chats after 24 hours, while important 'Interview Mode' conversations are stored permanently."
