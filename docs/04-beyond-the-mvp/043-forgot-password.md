# 4.3 Implementing the Secure "Forgot Password" Feature

A critical feature for any application with user accounts is a secure and user-friendly password reset flow. The implementation of this feature for LoveCppDSA was a deep dive into secure API design, multi-step form management in React, and the power of reusable code.

### A Secure, Multi-Step Process

The design for the password reset flow was centered around security and a clear user experience. A three-step process was chosen:
1.  **Email Submission:** The user provides their email address.
2.  **OTP Verification:** The user must prove ownership of the email by submitting a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to them.
3.  **New Password Entry:** Only after successful OTP verification is the user allowed to enter and save a new password.

This multi-step approach is a security best practice. It prevents **user enumeration attacks** (by not revealing whether an email exists in the database on the first step) and ensures only the true owner of the account can proceed with a password change.

### The Backend: A Journey of Refinement

Initially, I considered verifying the OTP and resetting the password in a single API call. However, this was incompatible with the desired three-step frontend experience. This realization led to a significant refactor of the backend logic.

The existing `verifyOTP` controller, used for new user registration, was not suitable because it also generated login tokens. To keep concerns separate, a new, dedicated `verifyResetPasswordOTP` controller and route were created. Its only job is to verify the OTP, cleanly separating the verification step from the final password reset step.

### The Frontend: Mastering State with the Context API

The greatest challenge was managing the state for the three-step form on the frontend. While Redux could have been used, this was a perfect opportunity to leverage React's built-in **Context API**. The `ForgotPasswordPage` was refactored to act as a "provider," managing the shared state (like the user's email and the current step) for its children components (`EmailInput`, `OtpVerification`, `NewPasswordInput`). This was an ideal use case for Context, as the state was complex but entirely localized to this one feature, avoiding unnecessary clutter in the global Redux store.

> **A Note on Functional Programming and Reusability**
>
> This feature was a powerful lesson in the value of functional, reusable code. Core utility functions built weeks earlier—like `sendEmail`, `generateOTP`, and the JWT generation methods—were reused like building blocks. This modular approach dramatically accelerated the development of this new, complex feature and is a testament to the power of a well-architected system.

This meticulous, full-stack implementation resulted in a secure, intuitive, and professional-grade password reset system.
